# Metric conformity

Differences between two datasets should be reflected in certain changes
in the metrics. This can be formalised in a set of rules, for example:

  - If the position of some cells are different than in the reference,
    the score should decrease.
  - If the topology of the network is different than that in the
    reference, the score should not be perfect.
  - The more cells are filtered from the trajectory, the more the score
    should decrease.

Here, we assess whether metrics conforms such rules
empirically:
